# React Test

## The following requirements must be met.

Please complete the user story below.
Your code should compile (if necessary) and run in one step. It is ok if there is a build process.
JavaScript should be used as a platform.
Use React.js.
Styles can be added with frameworks, libraries, plain css, preprocessors or postprocessors, be imaginative!
You must use this placeholder URL for getting the images: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

### Nice to have:

The images canâ€™t pop or flicker, they must appear smoothly on the screen.

### User Story

As a user visits the root URL
The user can see a grid of images that fill the screen on load
As the user scrolls the browser, more images are loaded dynamically
When the user clicks an image, it is removed from the list and disappears
Acceptance criteria

The grid should be responsive, showing 2 columns on small devices and more as the device width growths.
